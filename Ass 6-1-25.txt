1. Give me some idea on what is a Data type. What are Primitive Data types and Non-Primitive Data types. Explain with some examples.

A. Data Type:
	• Data Type specifies the kind of data a variable can hold. It creates a memory block to hold the particular value. These memory blocks further can be called using the declared 		variables.

	For Ex: 
		• An integer data type (int) can store whole numbers.
		• A string data type (String) can store sequences of characters.

	Categories of Data Types:
		1. Primitive Data Type
		2. Non-Primitive Data Type

    Primitive data type:
 	• Primitive data types are the simplest types of data that represent a single 	value.
	• They are the default data type that are offered by the language

 	Types of Primitive Data Type:

		• Number: Represents numeric values.
  		Example:
			let age = 25;
			let price = 99.99;

		• String: Represents a sequence of characters.
  		Example:
			let name = "John";
			let greeting = 'Hello, World!';

		• Boolean: Represents logical values, true or false.
  		Example:
			let isActive = true;
			let isLoggedIn = false;

		• Undefined: A variable declared but not assigned a value.
  		Example:
			let user;
			console.log(user);

		• Null: Represents an explicitly empty or non-existent value.
  		Example:
			let noValue = null;

  Non-Primitive Data Type:
	• Non-primitive (or reference) data types can hold collections of values or more complex entities.
	•They are kind of User-Defined Data Type

	Types of Non-Primitive Data Type:

	• Object: Used to store collections of key-value pairs or more complex structures.
  	Example:
		let person = {
  			name: "Alice",
  			age: 30
		};
		console.log(person.name);

	• Array: Special type of object used to store ordered lists of values.
  	Example:
		let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
		console.log(numbers[2]);
